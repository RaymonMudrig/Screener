# Relayout Plan

We have only small portion of GUI in the application to show Stock Screener feature. It is only about quarter of whole screen. So we need to re-arrange this GUI into more concise layout.

Here are some of my idea:
1. Remove the page title.
2. The page will be divided into 2 area: top panel and content area.
3. Top panel will contains: Pattern select input, buttons (Run, Add, Edit, Delete).
4. Content area will tabbed area : Tab buttons and Stock input to type in Stock Code to analyze, and overlapping content area selectable from tab-buttons.
5. First tab wil show Pattern info and Run Screen result table.
6. Other tabs (max 4) will show Stock analyzer result. If more than 4 stocks entered the first one weill be deleted.
7. Because of limited are, please make spacing, margins and padding rather thight.
