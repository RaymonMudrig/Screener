# Next Step
After we have preset pattern based screener and stock analyzer. Next step is to create custom user pattern.

# Concept
User can create his own screener pattern by selecting from various technical signal and fundamental metric (with its boundary value).

- For each technical signal the control will be: enable/disable toggle, bullish/bearish toggle if applicable.

- For each fundamental metrics the control will be: enable/disable toggle, Min Value and Max Value.

# Target to accomplish
1. Custom pattern editor.
2. Custom pattern listed along with preset pattern.
3. User can create and edit pattern as well as renaming and delete.
4. On "Select Pattern" panel add new buttons "Add" "Delete" and "Edit".
5. When user click "Add" or "Edit" Custom pattern editor is displayed for user to create or edit. Renaming also performed in this editor.
6. When user click "Delete" the current custom pattern will be deleted.
